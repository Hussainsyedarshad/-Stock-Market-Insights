Stock Market Insights
ðŸ“Š Harnessing Data to Predict Stock Trends
Investing in the stock market requires understanding more than just numbersâ€”itâ€™s about identifying the story behind the data. My latest project leverages historical data to visualize market trends and identify actionable patterns.

ðŸ’¡ What I Did:

Retrieved stock data using yfinance for major companies.
Computed moving averages (50-day and 200-day) to assess long-term trends.
Analyzed trading volumes to spot potential breakouts or reversals.
ðŸŒŸ Key Insights:

Crossovers between 50-day and 200-day moving averages strongly correlated with trend reversals.
High trade volumes often preceded significant price changes by 1-2 days.
ðŸ”— Real-World Application:
This project equips investors with tools to navigate volatile markets, identify trends early, and make decisions with confidence. Explore the full analysis on GitHub! ðŸ“ˆ
